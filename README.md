# LiveATC

Go to the LiveATC site and choose the frequency to listen to

Use the option [Launches your mp3 player]

It should download a .pls file

Open the .pls file in a text editor and find the url
  e.g. http://d.liveatc.net/kjfk9_s

Navigate to that website and it should redirect you to a site with only the audio file.

Copy the URL from the address bar and remove the `?nocache-----` bit

Input that URL to the popup that asks for the URL when you enter this site.
